# Hi there, I'm Rohan Malige! 👋

### 👨‍💻 CS Graduate @ UC Davis | Full Stack Developer | ML Enthusiast

I hold a B.S. in Computer Science & Engineering from the **University of California, Davis**. I love building cross-platform mobile apps, designing intelligent machine learning systems, and exploring blockchain technology.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Parkinson’s Research App** (iOS) for the **Dr. Chang Lab** and developing ML pipelines for neuroscience research.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **Open Source Machine Learning projects**.
- 🤝 I’m the **Co-founder of the Machine Learning Student Network** and was a **Tech Director** at the Google Developer Student Club. I was also the VP of Marketing and Technical Mentor for [SacHacks](https://sachacks.io/)
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I love pushing myself to learn new skills, ranging from **Generative AI** to **CUDA programming**!

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🧠 Parkinson’s Research App (CPA)

**Clinical iOS Research Application — Dr. Chang Lab | University of California, Davis**

A research-grade iOS application for longitudinal monitoring of Parkinson’s disease symptoms in study participants.

- Built using **Swift** and **SwiftUI** with a modular, questionnaire-driven architecture.
- Implements validated clinical scales including **MDS-UPDRS**, **PDQ-39**, **PFS-16**, **KPPS**, **BDI-II**, **SCOPA-AUT**, **PAS**, and **FOG-Q**.
- Supports daily check-ins and monthly questionnaires, with responses stored as structured **question–answer pairs** for clinical interpretability.
- Backend powered by **AWS (API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB)**; patient data is uploaded securely and **never stored locally on-device**.
- Designed for controlled, internal research deployment (non–App Store distribution), with clinician-facing analysis planned via a future dashboard.

> *Developed in collaboration with clinical researchers for real-world Parkinson’s disease studies.*



### 🧪 [Neuronal Spike Analysis Pipeline (MEA_Analysis)](https://github.com/rohanmalige/MEA_Analysis/tree/dev_branch)
**Ben Shalom Lab | UC Davis MIND Institute**
* Developed a scalable **ETL pipeline** for analyzing **single-neuron spike data** from lab-grown mouse brains to support early detection of neurological diseases.
* Built using **Python**, **SpikeInterface**, and **Kilosort**, with **multiprocessing optimizations** achieving up to **80% speedup**.
* Migrated compute-intensive workflows to **NERSC supercomputers** for high-throughput neural data processing.
* Designed an interactive **Plotly Dash web application** for uploading **CSV / MATLAB** data and generating spike histograms, firing-rate plots, and **LDA visualizations**.
* Applied **machine learning classification techniques** to distinguish **healthy vs. diseased neuron activity**, with model interpretability using **SHAP**.

### 📱 [CrypGo](https://github.com/rohanmalige/crypgo)
**Mobile Crypto Wallet & Blockchain Fabric**
